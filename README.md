# kubel

Emacs extension for controlling Kubernetes with limited permissions.

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

You can [watch how kubel started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3krYEeqnyk) or [read about it](https://gist.github.com/abrochard/dd610fc4673593b7cbce7a0176d897de).

## Features
We now support managing pretty much any resource!

- switch context and namespace
- show any resource (pods/services/deployments/etc)
- highlight a resource by name
- copy resource name to clipboard
- show and edit resource details
- show rollout history for a resource
- delete a resource
- tail container logs (possibly with `-f` follow flag)
- copy container log command to clipboard
- port forward a pod to your localhost
- exec into a pod using tramp
- quick run shell-command

## Installation

Get it from Melpa, or copy and load the `kubel.el` file.

If you want to have the evil compatibility package, get it from Melpa as well or
load the `kubel-evil.el` file.

## Usage

To list the pods in your current context and namespace, call
```
M-x kubel
```
To set said namespace and context, respectively call
```
M-x kubel-set-namespace
M-x kubel-set-context
```
Note that context will autocomplete but not necessarily namespaces
depending on your permissions and cluster setup.
See the [customize section](#Customize) on how to tune `kubel-use-namespace-list`.

To switch to showing a different resource, use the `R` command or
```
M-x kubel-set-resource
```
This will let you select a resource and re-display the kubel buffer.

## Shortcuts

On the kubel screen, place your cursor on a resource
```
enter => get resource details
C-u enter => describe resource
h => help popup
? => help popup
! => quick run shell-command
E => quick edit any resource
g => refresh
k => delete popup
r => see the rollout history for resource
p => port forward pod
l => log popup
e => exec popup
j => jab deployment to force rolling update
C => set context
n => set namespace
R => set resource
K => set kubectl config file
F => set output format
f => set a substring filter for resource name
M-n => jump to the next highlighted resource
M-p => jump to previous highlighted resource
m => mark item
u => unmark item
M => mark all items
U => unmark all items
c => copy popup
$ => show process buffer
s => show only resources with specified label value
```

## Editing a resource

After describing a resource in YAML format, you can edit the buffer and hit `C-c C-c` to apply your changes.

For example, if you want to edit a deployment, you can switch the resource with `R` and select "Deployments", then press return with the cursor on the row you wish to edit, edit the buffer, and hit `C-c C-c` to apply.

Alternatively, you can hit `E` to then select the resource type and the resource name of what you want to edit.

## Customize

- By default, kubel log tails from the last 100 lines, you can change the `kubel-log-tail-n` variable to set another line number.
- If you need to switch or set your kubectl config file by setting your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, you can use the wrapper function `kubel-set-kubectl-config-file` or the `K` shortcut.
- Namespace listing for auto-completion is controlled by `kubel-use-namespace-list`:
  - auto - default, use `kubectl auth can-i list namespace` to determine if we can list namespaces
  - on - always assume we can list namespaces
  - off - always assume we cannot list namespaces
